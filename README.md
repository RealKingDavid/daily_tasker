# daily_tasker
This project reads a list of tasks from a text file, analyzes each task using a Large Language Model (LLM), and generates a structured summary that includes task descriptions, complexity levels, and estimated completion times. The output is saved to a new file for easy reference. Ideal for productivity tracking or project planning.
